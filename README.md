# UDP-Performance-Comparison
A University Software Engineering project designed to compare the performance of a UDP client-server transmission between Java and C#

3 text files are provided for testing. To change the file that the app sends, simply run 
 - rm text.txt
and copy the desired file into a new text.txt, for example
 - cp 1mb.txt text.txt
Runs the app with a 1mb file.

gen.py can be run to regenerate the dummy text files, but it shouldn't be necessary as they are already included.
